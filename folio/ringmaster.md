# Project Share - Ringmaster [ðŸ”—](https://tommo.page/ringmaster)

[**Project Share**](projectshare.compsoc.com) is the University of Edinburgh's tech makers club, it's a vibrant fortnightly gathering to show off cool projects, and has grown from a small gathering of a few nerds in 2023 into a lively and supportive community space. In the nostalgic spirit of the early web, we have set up a webring with our portfolio websites. Anyone who attends project share can add their site to the [ringmaster repo](tommo.page/ringmaster).

As the technical architect of the ringmaster, I implemented a simple way to manage the hyperlinking from a plain text file on Github. 

This webring is one way we support our Project Share community and promote each other.
