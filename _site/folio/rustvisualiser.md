In order to learn Rust, I decided to build a simple music visualiser. I've always loved tinkering with music visualisation, in the same way that I'm fascinated by the way that amazing dancers translate a song into physical motion that is entirely different yet coherent. This interest culminated in me completing a 2 year Master's project demonstrating the editability of a visualised audio signal saved as an image.

## Features

The visualiser is built with Rust and OpenGL. It's a simple application that visualises the real time sound output of the computer.

## Technologies Used

- Rust
- OpenGL
