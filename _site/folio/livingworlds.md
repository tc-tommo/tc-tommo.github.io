# Living Worlds [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/tctom/living-worlds)

Living worlds for wallpaper engine is the adaptation of the marvellous work of Mark Ferrari, a 1980s artist who created art for some of the most iconic video games of the time. His art combines the pixelated aethetics of 1980s video games with some truly stunning animation effects which use only the colourisation to achieve a convincing motion in the scene. The technique is a true lost art of the 1980s; when computers were not powerful enough to store and render full motion video.

## My adaptation

My goal with this project was to get some experience with shader programming in OpenGL. The [online adaptation of his works by Joe Huckaby](https://www.effectgames.com/games/living-worlds) is implemented in 2015 era Javascript. I also wanted to try and recreate the animation effects seen in original 1980s games, but updated to performant GPU implementation that could run in the background using minimal resources. I wanted to use a low level language that allowed me to get as minimal overhead as possible, for this I chose Odin, a very minimal language designed for Data-Oriented Programming.
