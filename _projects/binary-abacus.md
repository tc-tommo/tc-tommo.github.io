Built a modern, interactive web application using React to help users learn about binary numbers, encoding systems, and bitwise operations. Implemented features including multiple rows for simultaneous values, configurable bit columns, and various encoding options (unsigned/signed binary, IEEE 754, ASCII). Created an intuitive UI with visual beads that change color based on position, keyboard shortcuts, and sound feedback. Designed with responsive layout and multiple interaction modes (keyboard/mouse) for accessibility.
